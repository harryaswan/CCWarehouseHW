### A program that can aid in the location of items within a warehouse

End of week revision 1 - CodeClan

The program has a preset list of items in bays ranging from a1-c10
and is designed with functions to aid in the retrieval of items within
a bay or to find out which item is in a selected bay.

**Extra**

Added function `print_collection_map(items_or_bays)` that will print a map of the warehouse
and highlight which bays have the requested items
